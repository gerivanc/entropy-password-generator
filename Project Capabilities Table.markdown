## Project Capabilities

This password generator offers **20 modes** for generating secure passwords, each with distinct entropy levels that reflect their cryptographic strength. The table below lists all modes, ordered by increasing entropy (bits), to highlight the progression from strong to ultra-secure configurations:

| Password Length | Character Set                              | Entropy (bits) | Security Level          |
