**EntroPy Password Generator** is a secure and customizable password generator written in Python. It creates strong passwords with configurable character sets and calculates their entropy to assess strength. The project provides 20 modes for generating strong passwords, ranging from 15 to 128 characters, with entropies from 95.10 bits to 811.50 bits, exceeding both the Proton© recommended minimum of 75 bits and the NIST best practices for cryptographic strength. 
With a command-line interface, it is ideal for developers, security enthusiasts, and anyone needing robust passwords.

## Disclaimer
I strongly recommend that you do not attempt to memorize the passwords generated by this method. Instead, use a reliable password manager, such as [Bitwarden©](https://bitwarden.com/), which I personally recommend and use. **Remember: the only password you must memorize is the master password for your password manager's vault. Additionally, it is essential to create a strong master password using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Whenever possible, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to further protect your data.**

## Features
- Generates passwords with lengths between 15 and 128 characters.
- Supports uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), and special characters (`!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?~\\\`).
- Option to exclude visually ambiguous characters (e.g., 'I', 'l', 'O', '0') for better readability.
- Calculates password entropy (in bits) to evaluate strength.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for flexible usage.
- Uses Python's `secrets` module for cryptographically secure random generation.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gerivanc/entropy-password-generator.git
   cd entropy-password-generator
   ```
3. No additional dependencies are required, as the project uses only Python standard libraries.

## Usage
Run the generator via the command-line interface:
```bash
python password_generator.py --length 20
```

### CLI Options
- `--length <length>`: Set password length (15 to 128, default: 66).
- `--no-uppercase`: Exclude uppercase letters.
- `--no-lowercase`: Exclude lowercase letters.
- `--no-digits`: Exclude digits.
- `--no-special`: Exclude special characters.
- `--with-ambiguous`: Include ambiguous characters.

### Example Password Modes
The project includes 20 predefined password generation modes, divided into two blocks:

#### Strong Passwords Block I (All with ambiguous characters, length 24):
1.    Lowercase + Special characters.
2.    Uppercase + Special characters.
3.    Uppercase + Lowercase.
4.    Uppercase + Digits.
5.    Lowercase + Digits.
6.    Digits + Special characters.
7.    Uppercase + Lowercase + Digits.
8.    Uppercase + Lowercase + Special characters.
9.    Uppercase + Digits + Special characters.
10.    Lowercase + Digits + Special characters.

#### Strong Passwords Block II (Mixed configurations):
11.    15 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters (95.10 bits entropy).
12.    18 characters, all character types, with ambiguous characters.
13.    20 characters, only lowercase letters and digits, no ambiguous characters.
14.    20 characters, only uppercase letters and digits, no ambiguous characters.
15.    24 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters.
16.    32 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters.
17.    42 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters.
18.    60 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters.
19.    75 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters.
20.    128 characters, all character types, no ambiguous characters (811.50 bits entropy).

These modes produce passwords with entropies exceeding the NIST recommendation of 75 bits, ensuring high security.

### Example CLI Usage
Generate a 20-character password with all character types, excluding ambiguous characters:
```bash
python password_generator.py --length 20
```
Output:
```
Generated password: K7mPq9xT2rZwYvN5jH
Entropy: 119.42 bits
```

Generate a 15-character password with only lowercase letters and digits:
```bash
python password_generator.py --length 15 --no-uppercase --no-special
```
Output:
```
Generated password: kxw9m4p7q2n8r5t
Entropy: 85.75 bits
```

## Password Entropy Calculation
The generator calculates password entropy using the formula: E(R) = log₂(RL). Entropy = log₂(possibilities per character) × password length. Higher entropy indicates a stronger password. The project's 20 modes ensure entropies from 95.10 bits (15 characters) to 811.50 bits (128 characters), surpassing the NIST minimum of 75 bits.
