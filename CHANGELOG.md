## [0.4.1] - 2025-04-28

### Added
- Added execution instruction in the script header of `password_generator.py`.
- Added `__init__.py` to `entropy_password_generator/` to ensure proper package structure, with version defined.
- Added a note in the `README.md` under the "Password Entropy Calculation" section, addressing the limitations of the entropy calculation (\( E(R) = \log_2(R^L) \)). The note highlights potential overestimation in real-world scenarios and suggests using tools like `zxcvbn` for practical strength validation.
- Added a styled quote block in the `README.md` to emphasize compliance with Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) entropy standards, enhancing visual appeal and user trust.
- Added an entropy minimum warning in `password_generator.py`. If the entropy of a generated password is below 75 bits (Proton© standard), a warning is displayed with contextual suggestions to improve security (e.g., increase length, include more character types).
- Added badges for "Keep a Changelog" and "Semantic Versioning" at the beginning of `CHANGELOG.md`, with links to their respective websites, to highlight adherence to these standards.
- Added a debug step in the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) to display the current commit and content of `password_generator.py`, aiding in diagnosing pipeline issues.
- Added a new section titled "Practical Applications of Entropy in Mobile Devices" in `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md`, providing practical context for entropy calculations.
- Added a table in `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md` comparing screen lock methods on Android© and iOS© devices, with entropy values ranging from 9-18 bits to 78-130+ bits.
- Added an introductory paragraph and a comparative note in the "Practical Applications of Entropy in Mobile Devices" section of `PASSWORDENTROPYCALCULATION.md`, linking entropy concepts to the project's password generation modes.
- Added the `pyproject.toml` file to the project root, enabling modern package configuration for PyPI publication and ensuring compatibility with tools like `build` and `twine`.

### Changed
- Updated version to `0.4.1` in `password_generator.py` to reflect recent changes.
- Improved error handling in `password_generator.py` CLI with more descriptive messages and usage suggestion.
- Updated CI workflow (`python-app.yml`) and PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) to ensure package structure with `__init__.py`.
- Updated `password_generator.py` to fix version inconsistency in header (from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0).
- Updated CI workflow (`python-app.yml`) to add more test cases (no special characters, with ambiguous characters) and additional debugging.
- Updated PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) to test the built package before publishing.
- Updated PyPI publish workflow (`pypi-publish.yml`) to fix checkout and publish errors by using manual git clone and correcting `packages_dir` parameter.
- Reorganized the `README.md` to separate "Strong Passwords Block I" and "Block II" into distinct sections for CLI usage and examples, improving clarity and usability.
- Updated entropy values in `README.md` to align with recalculated values based on the `password_generator.py` code, ensuring consistency across documentation.
- Modified the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) to temporarily adjust the Flake8 command to lint only `password_generator.py`, isolating the source of linting errors during debugging.
- Attempted to apply a custom color (Verde Brilhante 1, #39FF14) to the "Secure by Design" note in the `README.md` under the "Password Entropy Calculation" section using HTML inline styling, but decided against the change due to GitHub Markdown's limited support for custom color rendering.
- Updated the default password length in `password_generator.py` from 66 to 72 characters to align with the expected default maximum length, enhancing the security of generated passwords by default.
- Updated the `--length` argument description in `README.md` under the "CLI Options - Usage Block I" and "CLI Options - Usage Block II" sections to reflect the new default value (`default: 72`), ensuring consistency between the code and documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed linting errors in `password_generator.py` (Flake8, rule W293) by removing whitespace in blank lines on lines 224, 277, and 293, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline build passes successfully.
- Addressed intermittent CI pipeline failures by confirming the correct version of `password_generator.py` (without whitespace in blank lines) and providing steps to update the repository and clear pipeline cache.

### Removed
- Removed the "Build Status" badge from `README.md` due to persistent linting failures in the CI/CD pipeline, as the issue was related to linting rules rather than functional errors.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-05-01

### Changed

### Changed
- Modified the `main()` function in `password_generator.py` to prioritize `--mode` over manual configuration arguments, generating only the password for the specified mode instead of all modes.
- Updated the CLI behavior in `password_generator.py` to display mode-specific output (e.g., "Mode X Password:") when `--mode` is used, improving user experience and clarity.
- Reorganized the "Usage" section in `README.md` to separate predefined mode usage (using `--mode`) from custom configuration, enhancing readability and usability.

- Added a note in the `README.md` under the "Password Entropy Calculation" section, addressing the limitations of the entropy calculation (\( E(R) = \log_2(R^L) \)). The note highlights potential overestimation in real-world scenarios and suggests using tools like `zxcvbn` for practical strength validation.
- Added a styled quote block in the `README.md` to emphasize compliance with Proton© (75 bits) and NIST (80+ bits) entropy standards, enhancing visual appeal and user trust.
- Added an entropy minimum warning in `password_generator.py`. If the entropy of a generated password is below 75 bits (Proton© standard), a warning is displayed with contextual suggestions to improve security (e.g., increase length, include more character types).
- Added badges for "Keep a Changelog" and "Semantic Versioning" at the beginning of `CHANGELOG.md`, with links to their respective websites, to highlight adherence to these standards.

- Updated entropy values in `README.md` to align with recalculated values based on the `password_generator.py` code, ensuring consistency across documentation.
- Modified the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`) to temporarily adjust the Flake8 command to lint only `password_generator.py`, isolating the source of linting errors during debugging.
- Attempted to apply a custom color (Verde Brilhante 1, #39FF14) to the "Secure by Design" note in the `README.md` under the "Password Entropy Calculation" section using HTML inline styling, but decided against the change due to GitHub Markdown's limited support for custom color rendering.
- Updated the default password length in `password_generator.py` from 66 to 72 characters to align with the expected default maximum length, enhancing the security of generated passwords by default.
- Updated the `--length` argument description in `README.md` under the "CLI Options - Usage Block I" and "CLI Options - Usage Block II" sections to reflect the new default value (`default: 72`), ensuring consistency between the code and documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed linting errors in `password_generator.py` (Flake8, rule W293) by removing whitespace in blank lines on lines 224, 277, and 293, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline build passes successfully.
- Addressed intermittent CI pipeline failures by confirming the correct version of `password_generator.py` (without whitespace in blank lines) and providing steps to update the repository and clear pipeline cache.

### Removed
- Removed the "Build Status" badge from `README.md` due to persistent linting failures in the CI/CD pipeline, as the issue was related to linting rules rather than functional errors.
